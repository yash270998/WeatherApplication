# WeatherApplication

The main idea of this assignment was to create a Weather Application. This application connects to 
Open Weather API using an AJAX Request and parses the returned XML Data into meaningful data that 
is useful for users when they launch the website.

The styling and animation is purely based on CSS3 and all the features have been added with JS.
Includes a toggle button to change temperature scale from Celcius to Fahrenheit and vice-versa.
Search different cities weather data.
Shows high and low of temperatures for the rest of the week.
Includes an add button allowing users to customize the cities on the home-page.
Includes 2 charts comparing Temparature vs Time and Humidity(%) vs Time.
Also includes a feature to compare Real Time weather data of two different cities.

There's a Demo mp4 attached in the Repo to get the feels of the web app. A document has also been provided 
to further explain each feature.
